# COVID-19 Death Count by State- Nonparametric K-sample Test

Analyzing COVID-19 deaths by State to see if States (their infrastructures and response to COVID-19, resources, density, etc)
have an effect on the number of deaths from COVID-19 using nonparametric Krustkal Wallis Test. 
States with the largest populations were chosen because their COVID-19 policies affect a large number of people and
they would be forced into a similar situation in terms of COVID 19 deaths and thus are comparable. These
states are California, Texas, New York, and Florida. 

The goal of this paper was to determine whether State COVID-19 response strategies have an effect on the
number of COVID 19 deaths for the four states with the largest populations in the United States, which are
California, Texas, New York, and Florida.



# Independence of Age and Sex for Number of Deaths due to COVID-19

Study was done to determine if Age and Sex are independent variables regarding COVID-19 related deaths.
The timeframe selected for analysis is March 2020 to the end of February 2021, and Age groups selected for analysis
are those 18 years and older who have died from COVID-19.
